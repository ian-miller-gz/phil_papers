Philosophy papers that I have written.

## Intermodal Process Reliabilism
A world-counting or propensity theory of process reliabilism, which I argue stands up to Feldman's famous No Distinction/Single Case objections.

## Motivation Patterns in our Moral Reasoning
A critical analysis of Robert Adams' theory of motivational patterns.

## DRAFT Intermodal Persistence
An argument that Lewisian metaphysics including concrete modal realism implies our indestructibility for similar reasons that the Everettian interpretation of quantum mechanics also may imply our indestructibility.
